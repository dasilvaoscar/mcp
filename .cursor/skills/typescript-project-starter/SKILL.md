description: Scaffold a minimal, conventional TypeScript project using Yarn, tsconfig with a baseUrl/paths alias so that `@` points to `src`, and a basic src structure and scripts, while leaving framework and architecture decisions to the user. Use when starting a new TypeScript project from scratch and you want a simple, customizable base with an `@` → `src` alias.

# TypeScript Project Starter

## Purpose

This skill helps set up a **small, clean TypeScript project skeleton** without imposing a specific application architecture or framework.

The goal is:
- **Do**: Initialize Yarn, TypeScript, a basic `src` layout, configure `@` to point to `src` via `tsconfig.json`, add a minimal ESLint setup, and add common scripts.
- **Do not**: Choose frameworks (React, Express, etc.) or high-level architecture unless the user explicitly asks.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The user says they want to **start a TypeScript project from scratch**.
- They want a **simple or minimal structure**, and prefer to design the architecture themselves.
- They want to use **Yarn** as the package manager (classic Yarn, not necessarily Plug'n'Play).

Avoid using this skill when:
- The user asks for a **framework-specific starter** (e.g. Next.js, NestJS); follow framework docs instead.
- The project is part of an existing monorepo with its own conventions.

## Workflow

Follow this workflow end to end.

### 1. Clarify minimal requirements (without over-questioning)

Ask only what is necessary:
- **Runtime target** (default to Node if unclear):
  - "Node script / backend", "library", or "browser app"?
- **Package manager**:
  - Default to **Yarn** for this skill. Only switch to another manager if the user explicitly asks.

If the user is vague, assume:
- **Node LTS** runtime (latest available LTS major)
- **Yarn** as package manager
- Single-package project (no monorepo).

### 2. Initialize the project

In the project root:
- Ensure **NVM** is available (this skill assumes NVM is installed and used to manage Node versions).
- Decide on the exact **Node LTS version** to use:
  - Prefer a specific LTS major or version string (for example: `24`), either provided by the user or chosen as the latest LTS.
- Configure `.nvmrc`:
  - If `.nvmrc` does not exist, create it in the project root with the chosen Node LTS version string as its only content.
  - If `.nvmrc` already exists and clearly points to a non-LTS version, suggest updating it to the desired LTS version.
- Use NVM to install/use that version:
  - Run `nvm install` (reads `.nvmrc`) and then `nvm use`.

- If there is no `package.json`, run:
  - `yarn init -y`

Never overwrite an existing `package.json` without checking; if one exists, **extend** it instead.

### 3. Install TypeScript and basic tooling

Add core dev dependencies (for Node-oriented projects):
- `typescript`
- `@types/node`
- `eslint`
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

Optional (only if the user wants them):
- `ts-node` or `tsx` for running TS directly

Example with Yarn (Node default):
- `yarn add -D typescript @types/node eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- Optionally (if user wants easy execution): `yarn add -D tsx`

### 4. Create a minimal `tsconfig.json`

If `tsconfig.json` does not exist, create a **simple, strict** config.

For Node 18+ default:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2021",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

This config:
- Makes `src` the **root** of the TypeScript sources.
- Sets `baseUrl` to `src` and defines a `paths` alias so that you can import modules using the `@` prefix, for example:
  - `import { something } from "@/utils/something";`
  - which resolves to `src/utils/something`.

Note: some runtimes or bundlers need extra configuration to honor `tsconfig` path aliases at runtime. This skill only sets up the TypeScript side; the user may configure bundlers or runtime helpers (like `tsconfig-paths` or bundler-specific alias options) later as they design the architecture.

For browser-oriented projects, adjust only if the user asks (e.g. `module: "ESNext"`, appropriate `lib` settings).

### 5. Create a simple folder and entry file structure

Create the minimal structure:
- `src/`
- `src/index.ts` (or another entry file if the user specifies)

Default content for `src/index.ts` should be **neutral** and non-opinionated, for example:

```ts
export function main() {
  console.log("Hello from TypeScript!");
}

if (require.main === module) {
  main();
}
```

Do **not** introduce additional layers like `controllers`, `services`, or `modules` unless the user asks. The user is responsible for designing the domain architecture.

### 6. Add useful npm scripts (minimal)

Update `package.json` scripts to include at most:

- `build`: `tsc`
- `start`: a simple way to run compiled code or a dev runner

For a Node project using `dist/index.js`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

If the user wants direct TS execution with `tsx`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

Also add a `lint` script for ESLint:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\""
  }
}
```

If the user wants **backend-focused hot reload using `tsx`**:

- Ensure `tsx` is installed as a dev dependency (see step 3).
- Use the `watch` mode so the entrypoint is re-run on changes under `src/`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

This gives a simple, Node-oriented development loop without introducing any browser bundler or frontend dev server.

Avoid adding additional formatting or testing scripts unless the user explicitly requests them, or you have already confirmed they want "basic tooling".

### 7. Add a minimal ESLint configuration

After dependencies are installed, always add a **basic TypeScript-aware ESLint setup**:

- Create a `.eslintrc.cjs` file in the project root with content similar to:

```js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  env: {
    es2021: true,
    node: true,
  },
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: "latest",
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: ["@typescript-eslint"],
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
  ],
  ignorePatterns: ["dist"],
};
```

This configuration is intentionally minimal:
- It lints TypeScript files using recommended ESLint and `@typescript-eslint` rules.
- It ignores the compiled `dist` output.
- It does **not** enforce any project-specific style or architecture; the user can extend rules later.

### 8. Optional: Prettier, tests (only on request)

If the user asks for **additional quality tooling**, you may:

- Add **Prettier** with a default configuration.
- Add a **test runner** (e.g. Vitest or Jest) if they mention tests.

Keep these choices lightweight and do not enforce any test structure beyond a simple `tests/` or `__tests__/` folder and one example test.

If the user does **not** ask for them, skip this step.

### 9. Verify and explain what was created

After scaffolding:

- List the created or modified files (e.g. `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`).
- Explain briefly:
  - **What** each file is for.
  - That the **architecture is intentionally minimal**, and they are free to design modules, folders, and patterns as they prefer.
- Optionally, suggest **next steps** in 1–2 sentences (e.g. "create a `src/app` module", or "set up routes/controllers") but do not implement them unless the user asks.

## Examples

### Example 1: New Node CLI tool

User: "Create a simple TypeScript project from scratch for a small CLI that I'll design later."

Agent should:
- Assume Node 18+ and Yarn.
- Run `yarn init -y`.
- Install `typescript @types/node` as dev dependencies using `yarn add -D`.
- Create `tsconfig.json` as above.
- Create `src/index.ts` with a basic `main()` and console log.
- Add `"build"` and `"start"` scripts.
- Tell the user what was created and that they can extend the structure as they design the CLI.

### Example 2: Browser library skeleton

User: "I want a minimal TypeScript library for the browser, I'll handle bundling and architecture."

Agent should:
- Ask for confirmation that bundling (Vite/Rollup/Webpack) will be handled separately.
- Initialize Yarn if needed.
- Install `typescript` only (no `@types/node` unless they request node-specific APIs) using `yarn add -D typescript`.
- Create `tsconfig.json` tuned for browser (e.g. `module: "ESNext"`, appropriate `target` and `lib`).
- Create `src/index.ts` that exports a placeholder function or object.
- Avoid picking any bundler or test framework unless the user asks.
